# ProSharp-design
ProSharp is a objective programing language. It’s inspiret by C#/java/C++. It can by use to create:
- ultrafast code – using pointers, assembler injection, code generation and rozwiniêæ inlines, processor cache manipulation (on system with that ability)
- low memory systems, but generated code will not be fast
- portable – x86, arm, atmel
- buisness process - allows writing long life process, process that can be serialized and deserialized during execution.
